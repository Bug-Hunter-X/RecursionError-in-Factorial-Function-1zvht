This repository demonstrates a common error in Python involving recursive functions: the lack of a proper base case to handle negative input.  The `bug.py` file contains the erroneous code, which results in a `RecursionError`. The solution (`bugSolution.py`) addresses this by adding a check for negative input, preventing the infinite recursion. This example highlights the importance of carefully defining the termination conditions in recursive functions to avoid stack overflow errors.
